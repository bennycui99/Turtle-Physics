# Turtle-Physics

A simple **2D physics engine** built in [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). This project demonstrates how to simulate turtle-based agents with **mass**, **velocity**, and **elastic collisions** in a 2D environment. It also features **gravity** and **boundary collisions** (bouncing off walls).

## Overview

This repository contains a NetLogo model that demonstrates basic 2D physics, focusing on:
- **Movement** under velocity and gravity,
- **Collisions** between turtles (elastic),
- **Boundary collisions** (bouncing off walls).

It is an educational example showing how to implement a rudimentary physics engine in the NetLogo environment.

## Features

- **Gravity** pulling turtles downward.
- **Elastic collisions** between circular turtles, with mass influencing collision outcomes.
- **Bounce off world boundaries**, reversing velocity when hitting walls.
- **Configurable** number of turtles, speeds, masses, etc.

## Requirements

- **NetLogo** (version 6.4.0 or later).  
  You can download NetLogo from the [official website](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

## Installation

1. **Clone** this repository or **download** it as a ZIP:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2.  Open NetLogo on your computer.
3.  Open the .nlogo file from within NetLogo (File â†’ Open...).
